# The Simpsons Hit and Run Remaster
An attempt at remastering the game because EA won't.

# FAQ:
## Are you aware of the possible copyright takedowns?
Yes I am aware of the possible copyright takedowns, if I receive a takedown for the game I WILL only takedown the already built game NOT the source code.

## Will you be selling the game or making it free?
I will NOT sell the game due to copyright reasons and I will NOT be monetising the game in anyway due to the same reasons. If you see an unofficial Simpsons Hit and Run remake which looks just like this for sale. DO NOT BUY IT.

## Will the full source code of the game be avaliable or for sale?
The source code of this game will be avaliable on the github repository for free and if I receive copyright takedowns I will only takedown the build release and not the source code.

## Will you keep the original elements of the game?
Yes. I will try to keep the original elements of the game in the remaster. I am basing the remaster off of a couple of YouTubers videos such as a video made by [Muckluck](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrMuckluckable).

## Will you be spending money on this game?
No. I will try my best to make the assets myself and not to spend money on this game, I already have about 200+ assets in the marketplace that cost thousands. If I do spend money it will only be a very small amount.

# Info
Activision owns the rights to The Simpsons Hit and Run game while EA owns the rights to selling the Simpsons games. There is a very big chance that there will never be a remastered version of The Simspons Hit and Run. If there is a remaster it will probably have A TON of microtransactions as EA is a money hungry company that thinks that they aren't rich enough.
